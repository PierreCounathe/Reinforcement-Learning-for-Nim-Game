# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Nim-Game
The Nim game is a mathematical strategy game in which two players take turns removing sticks from distinct heaps. The player removing the last sticks loses. I build a version of the game that can be played in the terminal, and then an Agent class that plays the game. This Agent implements the Q-Learning algorithm.
